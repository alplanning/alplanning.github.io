                                    local Councillors. The site had
                                    previously had a farmhouse with associated structures on it for decades, right up

                                    remain visible at the surface to this very day. National planning policies can be
                                    utilised to encourage the use of such
                                    sites; i.e. those with a history of development or with old structures upon them. It
                                    is my job to assist the Planning
